## Topic 6 
Risk Management

### Description:
The rapid growth of mega-constellations in low Earth orbit (LEO) poses a serious threat to the space environment and national interests. The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment, analysis, and identification for mega-constellations in LEO, and to propose effective and feasible risk management strategies and solutions. The project will focus on the current and future scenarios of mega-constellation deployment and operation, and will consider the technical, legal, economic, national sovereignty and cyber security of the problem.

### Guideline:

1. **Understand Target Domain**:
First, you need to understand what mega-constellations in LEO. 
- **Starlink**, operated by the American company SpaceX, which plans to launch up to 42,000 satellites in LEO to provide global Internet service.
- **OneWeb**, a British company that aims to deploy about 6,400 satellites in LEO to offer high-speed Internet access to remote areas.
- **Iridium Next**, a constellation of 66 satellites in LEO that replaced the original Iridium constellation and provides satellite telephony and data services.
- **Globalstar**, a constellation of 48 satellites in LEO that offers voice and data communication services, as well as satellite-based tracking and messaging devices.
- **Flock**, a constellation of small satellites operated by the American company Planet Labs, which provides high-resolution Earth imagery and analytics.

2. **Identify Relevant Risks**:
Second you need to understand why they pose a risk to the space environment, other satellites, national sovereignty, and in particular to cyber security. 
You need to identify the main sources and types of risks associated with mega-constellations in LEO, such as collision, debris, interference, regulation, and cybersecurity. You can use a risk identification framework, to help you categorize and prioritize the risks based on their likelihood and impact.
 
 1. **Analyize Risks**:
 Third, you need to analyze the risks and assess their potential consequences and mitigation strategies. You can use a risk analysis tool, to help you quantify and visualize the risks and their interdependencies. You can also use a risk assessment matrix to help you evaluate the risks and decide how to respond to them.

1. **Communicate Risks**:
Fourth, you need to communicate the risks and your recommendations to the stakeholders and decision-makers of your project. You can use a risk report template to help you structure and present your findings and suggestions in a clear and concise way.

## Topic 4 
Development Focused
### Description:
This project aims to develop a real-time tool for evaluating the cryptographic quality of encrypted data streams generated by IoT devices. The relevance of this problem stems from the growing use of IoT devices and the increasing need for secure communication. However, many mistakes and implementation flaws occur in practice, leading to a weakening of encryption quality. The proposed tool will play a crucial role in detecting the cryptographic quality of encrypted data streams

## Topic 3 
Methodology R&D Focused
### Background:
- Wide-trail strategy: This highly successful design principle ensures provable security bounds against linear and differential cryptanalysis in SPN (Substitution-Permutation Network) ciphers. Its focus lies in maximizing diffusion through linear layers and minimizing weight of differential trails.
- Non-SPN ciphers: These ciphers employ diverse operations beyond substitutions and permutations, offering potential for resilience against evolving cryptanalytical techniques. However, designing non-SPN ciphers with provable security guarantees remains a challenge.
Recent research trends (past 5 years):  
- Sparx and LAX: These ARX-based ciphers (Addition, Rotation, Xor) utilize the "Long Trail Strategy" to achieve provably secure non-SPN designs. Long trails focus on large S-boxes with moderate diffusion, contrasting with the wide-trail approach.
- Mixed ciphers: Combining SPN and non-SPN operations (e.g., PRESENT, SKINNY) demonstrates promising security features and performance enhancements. However, provable security analysis for such structures remains complex. 

### Problem:
Investigate and develop a design strategy for mixed ciphers that offers provable security bounds against advanced cryptanalytic attacks (e.g., integral cryptanalysis, boomerang attacks) by leveraging both wide-trail and long-trail principles.

### Guideline:

1. **Understand the basics**: Thoroughly analyze existing works on wide-trail strategy, long-trail strategy, mixed ciphers, and relevant cryptanalytic techniques. This informs your understanding of design principles, security vulnerabilities, and potential research gaps..

2. **Formalize design strategy**: Define the specific mix of SPN and non-SPN operations you'll employ. Develop a clear framework for incorporating wide-trail and long-trail principles within the chosen mixed structure. 

3. **Security Analysis**: TUtilize formal mathematical tools (e.g., Boolean functions, trails, differentials) to derive provable security bounds against targeted cryptanalytic attacks. This demonstrates the robustness of your proposed design strategy.

4. **Implementation**: Implement your proposed cipher and compare its performance (e.g., encryption/decryption speed, memory footprint) with existing ciphers. This showcases the practicality and efficiency of your research.

5. **validation**: Analyze the effectiveness of your security analysis by applying attack simulations on your implemented cipher. Compare your design with other mixed ciphers in terms of both security and performance.

## Topic 2 
AI Application Focused
### Description:
Traditional methods for finding high-probability trails in ciphers can be computationally expensive and limited in scope. Deep learning models have shown potential in discovering complex trails with higher probabilities.
In this project, you will develop a deep learning architecture that efficiently identifies high-probability trails for a specific cipher with better results compared to existing methods. 
A distinguisher is a tool that can distinguish between a random permutation and a cryptographic algorithm. In this context, a machine learning-based distinguisher is a tool that uses machine learning techniques to distinguish between a random permutation and a cryptographic algorithm. Recent research has shown that machine learning-based distinguishers can be more efficient than traditional distinguishers 

### Guideline:

1. **Understand the basics**: Before you can design a machine learning-based distinguisher, you need to have a good understanding of the basics of differential cryptanalysis. You can start by reading [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/913.pdf).

2. **existing ML distinguishers**: You should study the existing machine learning-based distinguishers that have been proposed in recent research. 

3. **Identify a suitable dataset**: To train a machine learning-based distinguisher, you need a suitable dataset. Luckily for this problem you can generate dataset by simulations.

4. **Preprocess the dataset**: You need to preprocess it to make it suitable for training your model. This may involve tasks such as data cleaning, feature extraction, and normalization.

5. **Train the machine learning model**: You can use a variety of machine learning algorithms to train your model, such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. You should experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best model for your dataset.

6. **Evaluate the performance **: You can do this by using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. You should also compare the performance of your model to that of existing distinguishers.
