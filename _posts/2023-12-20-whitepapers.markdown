### What is a Digital Certificate ? ###
*2023-12-23*|
A digital certificate serves as a definitive proof of information authenticity through the application of a digital signature. 
Typically, this certificate comprises the public key of a party, be it a website or user, along with a digital signature from a Certification Authority (CA). Anyone who trusts in CA can verify the signature, thereby validating the public key to the respective party.
When you access a website with an HTTPS in its URL, the browser tries to ascertain whether the site possesses a valid digital certificate issued by one of the CAs trusted by your browser.

### Quest for Quantum Supremacy ###

Quantum computer cannot be built in 100 years: This view assumes that quantum technology is complex and may take time before reaching the level of performance and functionality that can pose a serious threat to traditional cryptography.
Quantum computer is just around the corner, due to breakthroughs in improving qubit quality and coherence. Therefore, it may take less than a decade before quantum computers can break encryption methods such as RSA or ECC.
Probably reality lies somewhere in between these two extremes.

### What is Digital Trust ? ###
*2023-12-21*|
Digital trust is a myth: This view argues that digital trust is impossible to achieve because digital technologies and services are inherently insecure, unreliable, and unethical. However, digital trust is a necessity and essential for the development and adoption of technologies and services. 
Consumers have a right to expect that their data will be treated with respect, their safety will be ensured, and their privacy will be protected.

### Password vs Passphrase ###
*2023-12-20*|
Passwords and passphrases represent two schools of thought in cybersecurity.
Passwords, often a mix of characters and symbols, are traditionally used but can be hard to remember and vulnerable to attacks. 
Passphrases, longer and composed of words, offer increased security due to their complexity and length. They are also more user-friendly, making them an increasingly favored choice in the digital security landscape.
