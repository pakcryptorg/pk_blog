*2023-12-20*|
Passwords and passphrases represent two schools of thought in cybersecurity.
Passwords, often a mix of characters and symbols, are traditionally used but can be hard to remember and vulnerable to attacks. 
Passphrases, longer and composed of words, offer increased security due to their complexity and length. They are also more user-friendly, making them an increasingly favored choice in the digital security landscape.
