## About PakCrypt
Cryptography plays a critical role in safeguarding communication and data on modern computer systems. There is a pressing need for a robust national strategy on cryptography that promotes its widespread use to protect the information interests of people and organizations, and to maintain national sovereignty.

### Our History
PakCrypt was initiated to promote young talent in the field of cryptography. The inaugural PakCrypt 2022 and later PakCrypt 2023 and 2024 competitions were resounding success. But PakCrypt is more than just a competition. It's a platform that provides young minds with opportunities to connect with industry experts, receive job offers, secure funding for further research, and engage in mutual collaboration.


### Why PakCrypt.org was founded?
Our mission is to promote awareness and understanding of cryptography among ordinary citizens, enabling them to make informed decisions about their privacy. Simultaneously, we aim to foster a conducive environment for state-of-the-art research in cryptography within Pakistan, to ensure our nation is at the forefront of advancements in this crucial field.

### PakCrypt Society 
PakCrypt Society's objectives are grouped under three key themes:

**Empower Tomorrow's Minds:** PakCrypt partners with schools and universities to host cryptography workshops and seminars, and organizes training and competitions to help students learn about cryptography and its role in privacy and data protection.

**Research & Development:** The society aims to foster world-class cryptography research and development, develop core competencies, advocate for sustained funding, and promote high-quality publications. The society guides career paths, establishes a collaboration platform, provides mentorship and support to young minds, and advocates for government and industry support for cryptography research.

**Scientific Exchange:** We organize annual cryptography meetings, conferences, and competitions for members and the wider cryptography community. We facilitate international training and networking opportunities to help members and the wider cryptography community advance their knowledge and skills.
